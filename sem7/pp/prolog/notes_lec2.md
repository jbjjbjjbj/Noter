# Logic Programming

## Herbrand

The *herbrand universe* denotes all the constants in the program.
Thus all the things we can talk about.

While the *herbrand base* is the set of possible facts.
So all the things that one can build using predicates and constants.
So any model is the subset of the *herbrand base*.
Just because something is in the *herbrand base* does not mean that it holds.

The *herbrand universe* is what we can talk about, while the *herbrand base* is what we can say about it.

## Minimal Model

A minimal model for some program P, does not contain a smaller Herbrand model for P.

Compute finite model with *least fixed point*, which calculates all things that are true.
Has something to do with *minimal model*, probably the saaaaaame??. TODO
